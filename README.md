# ApiDemo
### For Proper README documentation view the Auth folder, optionally for a Pages Swagger Demo follow the link below. : (Will create MOQ endpoints) 
</br><a href="https://patrick-gourdet.github.io/ApiDemo/">Pages Seagger Implementation</a>
### Disclaimer I had to dissect the swagger application to be able to alter it to my liking. 
## Id like to write a demo with the entire procedure and the number of things I tried that did not work, in .NET but I am not sure if there is any interest should there be any questions, feel free to reach out.

Warm Regards 

Patrick G. R.
